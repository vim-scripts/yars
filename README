Add support:
* ".. code-block::"
* ".. math::"
* ".. graphviz::"
* rst list syntax

PS: I already send a patch to the maintainer, didn't get response yet.  Maybe in the future, official syntax would contain my patch.  Anyway I released it as a plugin, since maybe someone would need this.  If you have any problem, contact me by e-mail.

This plugin contains some codes from vimscript #4112. This is a good plugin, though it does not fit my taste.
